################## Author's useless notice
I'm not responsible for anything which happens to your device although this kernel has been tested before
being released officially. Kernel update will be released mostly every month now except if a major bug has to
be fixed.


##################  MAIN FEATURES OF R4.4.3

1) Disabled Samsung security features (E.g: defex, dm verity, rooting restrictions, knox ncm…)

2) Disabled CRC check on data blocks which improves performance and also enabled toggleable CRC check feature.

3) Removed dirty status from scripts for github.

4) Enabled all governors except Schedutils governor.

5) Overclocked CPU as follows:
	BIG Cores: from 1560 MHz to 2080 MHz.
	LIL Cores: from 1352 MHz to 1690 MHz.

6) Removed a bunch of debugging and logging codes

7) Added GPU thermal and voltage control (Can be controlled in HkTweaks) 

8) Added latest boeffla_wl_blocker V 1.1.0 and disabled some wakelocks.

9) Some optimisations for overall performance in kernel

10) Balance battery and performance by reducing CPU wake-ups

11) Added NEON accelerated XOR implementation which improves performance by about 20%

12) Use neon-vfpv4 and softfp

13) Enabled support for NTFS filesystems.

14) Use TCP Congestion algorithm instead of BIC (network speed improvement)

15) Added battery control 

16) Optimized cpufreq and interactive governor.

17) Use -O3 optimization for inputs and crypto.

18) Optimised kernel for performance instead of size

19) GPU max frequency overclocked from 676 MHz to 1300 MHz

20) Underclocked CPU as follows:
	BIG Cores: from 936 MHz to 520 MHz.
	LIL Cores: from 839 MHz to 449 MHz.

21) Mark some IRQS and Kthreads as performance critical

22) Patch SafetyNet to bypass detection

23) Enable zram support and set default compressor as lz4.

24) Reduced transition latency for cpu frequencies.

25) Removed verity flag from dt.

26) Allow undervolting of gpu by 100 mV

27) Switch to a lower charging voltage more quickly. This results in a slight reduce in battery capacity
(about 3% less usable capacity) but this helps to extend the cycle life of the battery.

28) Fixed CPU throttling of both clusters. All cores will get throttled only if temperature is above 95'C

29) Adjusted default gpu highspeed clock to 1001 MHz for a smoother ui experience.

30) Enable deadline I/O scheduler (by developper Gabriel)

31) Upstream LZ4 compressor module and other related optimisations.

32) Implemented Dynamic FSync 2.0 (Disables Fsync when screen is on so as to improve performance)

33) Reduced touchscreen touch latency (To solve a bug on I2C).

34) Upstreamed kernel version from 4.4.177 to 4.4.238 which is the latest stable version.
Upstreaming allows kernel to have latest security updates, bug fixes, various code improvements
and so on released by linux developpers.

35) Built with Linaro V6.5.0 toolchain. Reason: Better performance

36) Other performance tweaks (developper Gabriel helped)


##################  MAIN FEATURES OF R5.0

37) Attempt to fix drivedroid support

38) Some tweaks for storage performance (better for swap)

39) Fake gpu model to Mali-G72 (Doesn't work probably because gpu model is provided by Vendor partition)

40) Tune CFQ I/O scheduler based on Pixel 4 (by developper Gabriel)

41) Improve code for safetynet bypass in case Google checks for other stuffs in the future.

42) Add ntfs3 driver by paragon software and switch to it. (Still requires app like ntfs mounter by paragon to
read ntfs filesystems because android os doesnt have necessary libraries to mount ntfs on its own)

43) Upstreamed kernel version from 4.4.238 to 4.4.241 which is the latest stable version.

44) Add a bunch of famous governors (bioshock, blu_active, smartmax, intelliactive, lionheart, and more)

45 Tweak gpu dvfs files' permissions for better performance as suggested

46) Added support for wireguard- A next generation vpn.

47) Enabled schedutil govenor.

48) Other minor performance tweaks

49) FOR ONEUI VERSION ONLY (arm64 vendor for A10 causes bootloop, so gsi version wont have these 2 features:
         * Use userspace lmkd instead of in-kernel lmk (better ram management)
         * Disable GFS for better ui responsiveness

50) Remove magisk v21 from kernel so that users can flash any magisk version they want)

51) Update Spectrum profile parameters


##################  MAIN FEATURES OF R6.1

57) CPU throttling bypass increased till 2184 MHz for big cores.

58) Updated spectrum profiles inorder to use max frequencies.

59) Automatic detection of root when flashing kernel. If you are already rooted, you won't lose root when
flashing kernel as from now. So, no need to flash magisk after kernel!!

60) Added powersuspend driver v1.8 - saves battery when screen is off.

61) Removed/disabled some more useless debugging codes and Samsung securities.

62) Added an improved version of KSM known as UKSM (Ultra Kernel Samepage Merging) - Decreases ram usage
